# Virtual Keyboard using Hand Gestures

This project demonstrates a virtual keyboard system implemented using hand gestures. It utilizes the MediaPipe library for hand tracking and OpenCV for video capturing and processing.

## Overview

The virtual keyboard system allows users to interact with their computers using hand gestures captured through a webcam. By moving their fingers in front of the camera, users can simulate keystrokes to input text or perform other keyboard actions.

## Features

- Hand gesture recognition: Detects hand gestures using the MediaPipe library.
- Virtual keyboard interface: Displays a graphical user interface of a virtual keyboard on the screen.
- Text input: Allows users to input text by selecting keys on the virtual keyboard.
- Special keys: Supports special keys such as space, backspace, and mode switch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- pynput
